	"general_help": "This is a GUI for StereoCrafter, a Stable Video Diffusion Inpainting Pipeline. It takes warped videos (e.g., from depth_splatting_gui.py) and fills in occluded areas. Input videos are expected to be either 'quad-splatted' (original, depth, mask, warped) or 'dual-splatted' (mask, warped). Outputs are either Side-by-Side (original | inpainted) or just the inpainted right eye, respectively. Adjust 'Tile Number' and 'Frames Chunk' if you encounter out-of-memory errors. 'Frame Overlap' helps smooth transitions between processed chunks. Use 'Original Input Bias' to balance consistency with the generated past vs. adherence to the original video source."
