# 🛠️ Manual Installation Guide for StereoCrafter  for Windows (UV Edition)

This guide walks you through manually installing the **StereoCrafter** using the uv package manager.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and available in your system's PATH:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [CUDA Toolkit 12.8 or 12.9](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
- [FFMPEG](https://techtactician.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-and-add-it-to-path-on-windows/)

---

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### 1. Verify CUDA Toolkit Installation

Check that `nvcc` is available and the version is 12.8 or 12.9:

```bash

nvcc --version

```

Look for output like:

```

Cuda compilation tools, release 12.8, V12.8.89

```

> If `nvcc` is not found or the version is incorrect, install the correct version from [NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

### 2. Install uv Package Manager

```bash

powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

```


### 3. Clone the Repository with Submodules & Change Directory Path

```bash

git clone --recursive https://github.com/enoky/StereoCrafter.git
cd StereoCrafter

```

> If the folder `StereoCrafter` already exists, delete or rename it before proceeding.



---

### 4. Setup and Install

```bash

uv sync

```


## 📦 Model Weights Installation

The models are required to run StereoCrafter. You can download them automatically using the Hugging Face CLI (provided by the huggingface-hub package in your environment).

### 1. Prerequisite: Accept Model Terms

The SVD model is "Gated." You must manually accept the terms of use before you can download it:

- 1. Log in to [Hugging Face.](https://huggingface.co/)
- 2. Visit the [SVD XT 1.1 Page.](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1)
- 3. Click **"Agree and access repository"**.

### 2. Authenticate your PC
You need a "Read" Token from your [Hugging Face Settings.](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) Run this command and paste your token when prompted:

```bash

uv run hf auth login

```

### 3. Download the Models
Run these commands from the `StereoCrafter` root folder. The CLI will automatically create the `weights` folder if it doesn't exist:

```bash
# 1. Download SVD img2vid (Gated - Requires Login)
uv run hf download stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1 --local-dir weights/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1

# 2. Download DepthCrafter (Open)
uv run hf download tencent/DepthCrafter --local-dir weights/DepthCrafter

# 3. Download StereoCrafter (Open)
uv run hf download TencentARC/StereoCrafter --local-dir weights/StereoCrafter

```

**Note:** Total download size is approximately 22GB. Ensure you have enough disk space.
Your downloaded weights should contain files matching the visual hiearchy below.

## ✅ Final Notes

- If any step fails, check your environment variables and permissions.
- Refer to `install_log.txt` (if generated during script-based install) for troubleshooting.
- CUDA support is critical for GPU acceleration. Ensure your drivers and toolkit are correctly installed.
